At Dicaire.com, like most tech companies, we depend on open source software from all over the world to help us get things done. We're grateful to the open source community, the projects, and especially their maintainers who have allowed us to innovate and make our customers working lives a little bit more enjoyable. 

Listed within this GitHub org, you'll find a collection of things built by us, which we think folks may find helpful or inspiring.

In the words of our friends at [Salesforce](https://opensource.salesforce.com/):

>Open source drives our industry forward, kick-starts new careers, and builds trust in the products we create. From using projects, making improvements, and sharing our most impactful innovations with the communityâ€“in open source, we want to leave it better than we found it.
